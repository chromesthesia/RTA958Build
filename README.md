- The piece requires 1 computer per room
- Each room runs a Processing Sketch and a PD patch (files are labeled for each room)
- You will need to have Processing 3.0 and PD-Extended installed on each computer
- Open the sketch and the patch
- Be sure the Audio settings on PD are correctly set and turn on DSP
- Turn up the gain slider within the patch (slider at the top of the patch) 
- There should be numbers populating in the number boxes within the patch 
- Run the Processing sketch and you should begin to see visuals being formulated on the sketch
